# Department Classifier

## Overview
This project aims to create an unsupervised model that classifies job listings into their respective departments based solely on the "Job Description" column. This approach can be particularly useful for organizing unstructured job data into coherent categories.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle:
[Booking.com Jobs EDA & NLP Ensemble Modeling](https://www.kaggle.com/code/niekvanderzwaag/booking-com-jobs-eda-nlp-ensemble-modeling/data)

## Tasks and Questions

### 1. Text Pre-Processing
Perform text pre-processing steps on the "Job Description" column and explain the utility of each step in the context of this task.

### 2. Cluster Identification
Identify the number of natural clusters present in the data.

### 3. Model Training
Train an unsupervised model to classify the jobs into their respective departments using only the "Job Description" column.

### 4. Keyword Identification
Identify key words from each cluster that are indicative of the department.

### 5. Model Deployment
Deploy the trained model in two different ways:
a. As a REST API endpoint
b. As a mobile app model
